# Observability
- Observability is the ability to measure the internal states of a system by examining its outputs. A system is considered “observable” if the current state can be estimated by only using information from outputs, namely sensor data. While it might seem like a recent buzzword, [the term originated decades ago ](https://www.encyclopedia.com/history/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/kalman-rudolf-emil) with control theory (which is about describing and understanding self-regulating systems). However, it has increasingly been applied to improving the performance of distributed IT systems. In this context, observability uses three types of telemetry data — metrics, logs and traces — to provide deep visibility into distributed systems and allow teams to get to the root cause of a multitude of issues and improve the system’s performance.
