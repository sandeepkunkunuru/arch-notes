![templates](./images/Screenshot%20at%202022-06-11%2013-57-58.png)
- A [template](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record/blob/main/templates/decision-record-template-by-michael-nygard/index.md) to capture ADR.
- [Examples](https://github.com/arachne-framework/architecture)

# Best practices

- Ideally maintain a decision todo list that complements the product todo list.
- Plain, direct language
- Brief, 1-2 pages max
- Markdown
- Stored with the code
- Peer review ADRs as you would code
- Delegate ADR creation.
- Not everything is an ADR!
- Immutable: Don't alter existing information in an ADR. Instead, amend the ADR by adding new information, or supersede the ADR by creating a new ADR
